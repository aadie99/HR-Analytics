# HR-Analytics
I have designed an interactive and dynamic Power BI dashboard to provide actionable insights for the Atliq HR team. 
The guided project focuses on analyzing HR data from April, May, and June 2022 to derive actionable insights. You can have the view at the dataset added into the files.

The objectives include:

1. Understanding employee working preferences.
2. Identifying trends in sick leaves and work-from-home leaves.

The goal is to empower the HR team with meaningful insights to optimize workforce management and improve operational efficiency.

Key Learnings from My Guided Project

1. Data Gathering and Transformation:
   
-> The raw data provided in Excel was not in the ideal format, requiring cleaning and transformation in Power BI Query Editor.

-> I cleaned and transformed the data dynamically, ensuring the process remains adaptable to future datasets.
*Pro Tip: When excluding or transforming data, always aim for a dynamic approach that can handle new data seamlessly.

3. Creating Metrics Using DAX
   
-> I learned to create metrics (also known as measures in Power BI) to help drive data-driven decision-making.

-> A key focus was on the CALCULATE() function in DAX, which evaluates expressions in a context modified by filters.
* To dive deeper into DAX functions, I recommend the resource: https://dax.guide/.

3. Dashboarding Techniques
   
-> A well-designed dashboard should not only present insights but also prompt users to ask deeper "why" questions based on top KPIs.

-> My dashboard includes features like:

a. Slicers for dynamic filtering.
b. Cards showcasing key metrics: Presence %, SL% (Sick Leave %), and WFH% (Work From Home %).
c. Tables, matrices, and area charts to add depth and clarity to the analysis.

The combination of these elements ensures the dashboard is both insightful and visually engaging.
